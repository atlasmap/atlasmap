## Apache Camel component
The latest version of `camel-atlasmap` component is now maintained in Apache Camel upstream
https://camel.apache.org/components/latest/atlasmap-component.html
https://github.com/apache/camel/tree/main/components/camel-atlasmap

We will keep maintaining Camel2 version of `camel-atlasmap` component in this repository for a while, however for Camel3 you need to go with the one from Apache Camel upstream.
