= Importing Java archive files into AtlasMap

AtlasMap can import a Java archive file and display mappable fields in
either the source or target panel. In the data mapper, each class-wide
public entity in a class file that is in the imported JAR file becomes a
mappable field.

Arrays and data types are more discretely defined.

Consider the following two files:

[source,java]
----
Bicycle.java:

package io.paul;
import io.paul.GeoLocation;

public class Bicycle {
    public int cadence;
    public int gear;
    public int speed;
    public float[] seatHeight;
    public String[] color;
    public GeoLocation geoLocation;
}
----

[source,java]
----
GeoLocation.java:
package io.paul;

public class GeoLocation {
    double lattitude;
    double longitude;
}
----

To import these files:

. Compile the Java files and assemble the results into a Java archive file.
For example, invoke the following commands to create the `Bicycle.jar` file:
+
----
javac -cp io.paul:. -d . GeoLocation.java Bicycle.java
jar cvf ../Bicycle.jar *
----

. In the main toolbar, click the *AtlasMap* menu and select *Import a catalog (.adm)*.

. In the *Open* dialog, navigate to the `Bicycle.jar` file and click *Open*.

. At the top of the *Source* panel, click
image:AddJavaClass.png[+]
to import the fields into the source panel.
+
To display imported fields in the *Target* panel, you would click
image:AddJavaClass.png[+]
at the top of the *Target* panel.

. In the *Load Java Document From Custom Class* dialog, in the *Custom class name* field,
select the class package name of the Java class. For example, in
`Bicycle.jar` file, the class package name is `io.paul.Bicycle`.

. Click *OK*.  If you import the sample `Bicycle.jar` file into the the
*Source* panel, you would now see something like the following.
The fields that are in the imported Java class files appear in the
panel into which they were imported.
