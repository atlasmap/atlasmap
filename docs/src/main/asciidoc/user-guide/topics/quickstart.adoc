= Quickly get started using AtlasMap UI standalone

To run AtlasMap UI standalone:

. Obtain the most recent AtlasMap version number:
.. Go to link:https://github.com/atlasmap/atlasmap/[]
.. Scroll down to see the `maven central` icon with the latest
version, for example:
image:latest-maven-central-version-number.png[maven central 1.42.3].

. Download the AtlasMap standalone `.jar` file by invoking the
`wget` command with the following format. Replace `${VERSION}`
with an actual version number.
+
----
wget https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/atlasmap/atlasmap-standalone/${VERSION}/atlasmap-standalone-${VERSION}.jar
----

. Run AtlasMap standalone by invoking the `java` command with the
following format:
+
----
$ java -jar atlasmap-standalone-${VERSION}.jar
----
+
For example:
+
----
$ java -jar atlasmap-standalone-1.42.3.jar

[NOTE]
====
Although it is not a common situation, you can start AtlasMap and also
load mapping definitions if you have an AtlasMap `.adm` file.
An AtlasMap `.adm` file contains mapping definitions that were exported from AtlasMap.
For example, suppose you want to start AtlasMap and
import the `/home/aslan/Downloads/atlas-mapping.adm` file.
Invoke a command such as the following:

----
$ java -Datlasmap.adm.path=/home/aslan/Downloads/atlas-mapping.adm -jar atlasmap-standalone-1.42.3.jar
----
====

. In a browser, visit
link:http://127.0.0.1:8585/[]
to see the AtlasMap data mapper canvas.

. Experiment with the data mapper:
.. At the top of the *Source* panel, click
image:Import-Data-Shape.png[Import]
to import a JSON or XML file that you can map fields from.
.. At the top of the *Target* panel, click
image:Import-Data-Shape.png[Import]
to import a different JSON or XML file that you can map fields to.
.. To map fields:
... Navigate to a source field and click image:CreateNewMapping.png[Create new napping].
+
The *Mapping Details* panel will slide in from the right.
+

... Either:
.... Navigate to a target field and click image:ConnectToSelectedMapping.png[Connect to the selected mapping] to add it to the
selected mapping, or
.... Drag and drop a target field on the source field to add the target field to the mapping.
.. With a data mapping selected, explore the optional transformations.
.. To preview a data mapping result, click
image:ShowMappingPreview.png[Show Mapping Preview] and enter sample data in source *Mapping preview* fields.
.. To save your work, click the *AtlasMap* menu and select *Export the current mappings and support files into a catalog (.adm)*
+

Then choose a folder in which to save an AtlasMap `.adm` file. This file contains the mapping definitions.
