= Mapping between collections and non-collections

In the data mapper *Source* and *Target* panels:

* image:CollectionIcon.png[Collection icon]
indicates a collection. If the collection contains one primitive type,
you can map directly from or to that collection. If the collection
contains two or more different types, the data mapper
displays the collection’s child fields and you can map to or from the
collection’s fields.

* image:FolderIcon.png[Folder icon] indicates an
expandable container that is a complex type. A complex type contains
multiple fields of different types. A field in a complex type can be a
type that is a collection, such as an array. You cannot map a complex
type container itself. You can map only the fields that are in the complex type.

To toggle the display of data types, such as `*(COMPLEX)*`,
`*STRING*`, `*INTEGER*`, click image:ShowTypesIcon.png[Show types icon] in the toolbar.

The following table shows the default behavior when mapping
between collection fields and non-collection fields.

.Changing default behavior when mapping from a collection field
When you map from a collection field to a non-collection
field, the default behavior is that the target field gets its
value from the last element in the source collection.
You can change this default behavior in the following
ways:

* To map from the element that you choose, apply the *Item At*
transformation to the source and specify an
index. For example, to map the
value that is in the first element that is in the collection,
specify `0` for the index.

* To map all values that are in
all elements that are in a
source collection, apply the *Concatenate* transformation
to the source collection or source collection field and optionally specify a delimiter.
The default delimiter is a space. For example,
consider this source collection:

** In the first element, the value in the *city* field
is *Boston*.
** In the second element, the value in the *city* field
is *Paris*.
** In the third element, the value in the *city* field
is *Tokyo*.

+
During execution, the data mapper populates the target
field with `Boston Paris Tokyo`.

.Changing default behavior when mapping from a non-collection field
When you map from a non-collection field to a collection
field, the default behavior is that the target collection contains
one element, which contains the non-collection, source field
value. You can change the default behavior
when the source field contains a series of values that are
separated by the same delimiter. For example, consider a
non-collection, source *cities* field that contains:

`Boston Paris Tokyo`

You would map this to a target collection or to a
target field that is in a collection.
On the source *cities* field, add the *Split* transformation.
During execution, the data mapper splits the value of the
*cities* field at the space delimiter. The result is a
collection that contains three elements. In the first
element, the value of the *city* field is `Boston`. In the
second element, the value of the *city* field is `Paris`.
In the third element, the value of the *city* field is `Tokyo`.
