= Finding the data field that you want to map

In a relatively simple integration, mapping data fields is easy
and intuitive. In more complex integrations or in integrations that handle
large sets of data fields, mapping from source to target is easier when
you have some background about how to use the data mapper.

The data mapper displays two columns of data fields:

* *Source* is a list of the data fields that you can map to target fields.
* *Target* is a list of the data fields that you can map source fields to.

To quickly find the data field that you
want to map, you can do any of the following:

* Search for it.
+
The *Source* panel and the *Target* panel each have
a search field at the top. Enter the name of the field you want to map.

* Enter the names of the fields that you want to map in the *Mapping Details* panel.
+
Click image:AddIcon.png[Add icon] in the toolbar to add a new empty mapping. The *Mapping Details* panel will slide in from the
right. In the *Sources* section, enter
the name of the source field. In the *Targets* section, enter the name of the
field that you want to map to.

* Expand and collapse folders to limit the visible fields.
+
Once the appropriate field is visible, you can drag it to a currently mapped field in the opposite panel to add it to that mapping.
