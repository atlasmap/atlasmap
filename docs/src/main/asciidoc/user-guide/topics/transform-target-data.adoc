= Transforming source or target data

In the data mapper, after you define a mapping, you can transform
any field in the mapping.
Transforming a data field defines how you want to store the data.
For example, you could specify the *Capitalize* transformation to ensure that the first
letter of a data value is uppercase.

.Procedure

or a separation mapping.

. In the *Mapping Details* panel, under *Sources* or under *Targets*,
in the box for the field that you want to transform, click image:LightningBoltIcon.png[Lightning bolt icon] to the left of the
