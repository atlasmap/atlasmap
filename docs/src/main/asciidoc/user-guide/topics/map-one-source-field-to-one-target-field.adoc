= Mapping one source field to one target field

The default mapping behavior maps one source field to one target field.
For example, map the `Name` field to the `CustomerName` field.

.Procedure

. In the *Source* panel, navigate to the data field that you want to map from.
+
You might need to expand a folder to see the data fields that it
provides.
+
When there are many source fields, you can search for the
field of interest by entering the field's name in the search field at the top of the *Source* panel.

. Click image:CreateNewMapping.png[Create new mapping] to add the field as a source of a new mapping.

. In the *Target* panel, navigate to the data field that you want to map to.
+
. Click image:ConnectToSelectedMapping.png[Connect to selected mapping] to add the field as a target in the selected mapping.

. Optionally, preview the data mapping result. This is useful when
you add a transformation to the mapping or when the mapping requires
a type conversion.
.. In the toolbar, click image:ShowMappingPreview.png[Show mapping preview] to display a text input field on the source
field and a read-only result field on the target field.
.. In the source field's data input field, enter text. Click somewhere
outside this text box to display
the mapping result in the read-only field on the target field.
.. Optionally, to see the result of a transformation, add a transformation
in the *Mapping Details* panel.

.. Hide the preview fields by again clicking image:ShowMappingPreview.png[Show mapping preview].

. Optionally, to confirm that the mapping is defined, in the upper right, click image:GridIcon.png[Grid] to display the defined
mappings in a table.

+
You can also preview data mapping results in this view.
If preview fields are not visible,
click image:ShowMappingPreview.png[Show mapping preview] and enter data as described in the previous step.
In the table of defined mappings, preview fields
appear for only the selected mapping. To see preview fields for another
mapping, select it.
+
Click image:ColumnIcon.png[Column icon] to display the data field
panels again.
