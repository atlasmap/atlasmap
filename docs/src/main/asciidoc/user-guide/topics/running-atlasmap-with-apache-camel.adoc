= Running AtlasMap with Apache Camel

Developers who are familiar with Apache Camel can implement a 
Camel application that uses the `camel-atlasmap` component. 
A `camel-atlasmap` endpoint 

* Can consume an AtlasMap `.adm` file
* Uses the content of `body` as the default source document for mappings

For example: 

----
from("direct:start")
   .to("atlas:atlas-mapping.adm")
   .log("${body}")
----

If  `body` contains a `java.util.Map` object, then `camel-atlasmap` 
uses `key` as a document ID and the corresponding value as the 
document payload.

You can obtain the `camel-atlasmap` component here:
