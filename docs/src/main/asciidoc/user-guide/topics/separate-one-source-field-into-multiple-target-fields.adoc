= Separating one source field into multiple target fields

In a data mapping, you can separate a compound source field into multiple
target fields. For  example, map the `Name` field to the `FirstName` and
 `LastName` fields.

.Prerequisite
For the source field, you must know what type of content is in each
part of this compound field, the order and index of each part of the content,
and the separator between parts, such as a space or comma. See
<<example-missing-unwanted-data>>.

.Procedure


. In the *Source* panel, navigate to the field that contains the content you want to separate and click
image:CreateNewMapping.png[Create new mapping].
. In the *Target* panel, for each field into which you want to map part of the source field's content, navigate to the field and
click image:ConnectToSelectedMapping.png[Connect to selected mapping].
+
The data mapper automatically changes the mapping type to *Split*.
+
When you are done selecting target fields, you should see lines from the
source field to each of the target fields.

. In the *Mapping Details* panel, in the *Delimiter* field,
select the character in the source field that indicates
where to separate the source field values. The default is a space.

. In the *Mapping Details* panel, under *Targets*, ensure that the target
fields are in the same order as the corresponding content in the
compound source field.
+
If necessary, increase or decrease the indexes next to a target field to achieve the desired order.

. Optionally, preview the data mapping result:
.. In the toolbar, click
image:ShowMappingPreview.png[Show mapping preview] to display a text input field on the source
field and read-only result fields on each target field.
.. In the source field's data input field, enter text. Be sure to enter
the separator character between the parts of the field. Click outside
the text box to display the mapping result in the read-only fields
on the target fields.
+
If you reorder the target fields or add a transformation to a target field
then the result fields on the target fields reflect this. If the data mapper
detects any errors, it displays informative messages at the top of the
*Mapping Details* panel.

.. Hide the preview fields by clicking image:ShowMappingPreview.png[Show mapping preview] again.
+
If you redisplay the preview fields, any data that you entered in them is
still there and it remains there until you exit the data mapper.

. To confirm that the mapping is correctly defined, click
image:GridIcon.png[Grid icon] to display defined mappings.
A mapping that separates the value of a source field into
multiple target fields looks like this:

+
You can also preview mapping results in this view. Click
image:ShowMappingPreview.png[Show mapping preview] and enter text as described in the previous step.
Preview fields appear for only the selected mapping. Click another
mapping in the table to view preview fields for it.
