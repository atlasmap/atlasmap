= General procedure for using AtlasMap standalone

To use AtlasMap standalone, the main steps are:


. Download the AtlasMap standalone `.jar` file.  

. Start running AtlasMap standalone. 

. In the AtlasMap data mapping canvas:

.. Import a source data file. 

.. Import a target data file. 

.. Map fields as needed, optionally applying transformations and/or conditions.

.. Export the defined mappings to a `.adm` AtlasMap catalog file. 

What can you do with an AtlasMap .adm file?

* Continue working on the mappings by importing the `.adm` file into AtlasMap.
* Execute the mappings in a Camel application that uses the 
`camel-atlasmap` component, which consumes `.adm` files.
