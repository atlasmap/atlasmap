= Combining multiple source fields into one target field

In a data mapping, you can combine multiple source fields into one
compound target field. For example, you can map the `FirstName` and `LastName`
fields to the `CustomerName` field.

.Prerequisite
For the target field, you must know what type of content is in each
part of this compound field, the order and index of each part of the content,
and the separator between parts, such as a space or comma. See
<<example-missing-unwanted-data>>.

.Procedure

. In the *Source* panel, navigate to the first field that
you want to combine into the target field and click image:CreateNewMapping.png[Create new mapping]. For each of the other
fields that you want to combine into the target field, click image:ConnectToSelectedMapping.png[Connect to selected mapping] next
to each field.
+
The data mapper automatically changes the type of mapping to *Concatenate*.

. In the *Target* panel, click image:ConnectToSelectedMapping.png[Connect to selected mapping] next to the field into which you want
to map all of the source fields.
+
When you are done you should see a line from each of the source fields to
the target field.

. In the *Mapping Details* panel, in the *Delimiter* field, select the
character that the data mapper inserts in the target field between the content
from different source fields. The default is a space.

. In the *Mapping Details* panel, under *Sources*, ensure that the source
fields are in the order in which they are expected to appear in the target field.
+
If necessary, increase or decrease the index number of a source field to achieve the desired order.

. Optionally, preview the data mapping result:
.. In the toolbar, click
image:ShowMappingPreview.png[Show mapping preview] and select
*Show Mapping Preview* to display a text input field on each source
field for the currently selected mapping and a read-only result field
on the target field of the currently selected mapping.
.. In the source data input fields, enter text. Click outside the
text box to display the mapping result in the read-only field on the target field.
+
If you reorder the source fields or add a transformation to the mapping
then the result field on the target field reflects this. If the data mapper
detects any errors, it displays informative messages at the top of the
*Mapping Details* panel.

.. Hide the preview fields by clicking
image:ShowMappingPreview.png[Show mapping preview] again.
+
If you redisplay the preview fields, any data
that you entered in them is still there and it
remains there until you exit the data mapper.

. To confirm that the mapping is correctly defined, in the upper right, click
image:GridIcon.png[Grid icon] to display the defined mappings.
A mapping that combines the values of more than one source field
into one target field looks like this:
image:CombineMapping.png[Combine mapping].
+
You can also preview mapping results in this view. Click
image:ShowMappingPreview.png[Show mapping preview] and enter text as described in the previous step.
Preview fields appear for only the selected mapping. Click another
mapping in the table to view preview fields for it.
