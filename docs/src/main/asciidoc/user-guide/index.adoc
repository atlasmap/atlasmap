[[introduction]]

AtlasMap is a data mapping solution with an interactive web based user interface.
It simplifies configuration of an integration that handles different
types of data represented by XML schema or instance files, JSON schema or instance files or Java class files.
You design your data mapping and transformations in the AtlasMap Data Mapper UI canvas, and then execute that mapping
by means of the AtlasMap runtime engine. We provide standard transformations or we
support custom, user-defined transformations.  We also have a camel-atlasmap component which consumes an
AtlasMap mapping definition which can process data mappings as a part of a Camel route.
