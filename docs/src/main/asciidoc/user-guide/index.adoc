[[introduction]]

AtlasMap is a data mapping solution with an interactive web based user interface.
It simplifies configuration of an integration that handles different
types of data including: 

* XML schema or instance files
* JSON schema or instance files
* Java class files

To use AtlasMap, you import your data shape definition files, map source
fields to target fields, optionally apply transformations or conditions, 
and then execute defined mappings by means of the AtlasMap runtime engine. 
AtlasMap provides standard transformations and 
supports the creation of custom, user-defined transformations.  

AtlasMap is available: 

* As a standalone application
* Embedded in 
link:https://syndesis.io/[Syndesis], which is an open-source integration platform

There is also a `camel-atlasmap` component that consumes an
AtlasMap mapping definition and processes data mappings as a part of a Camel route.

This user guide is organized as follows:
