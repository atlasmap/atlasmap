[[introduction]]

AtlasMap is a data mapping solution with an interactive web based user interface.
It simplifies configuration of an integration that handles different
types of data including: 

* XML schema or instance files
* JSON schema or instance files
* Java class files

To use AtlasMap, you start from AtlasMap UI and import your data shape definition files,
 map source fields to target fields, optionally apply transformations or conditions,
and then execute defined mappings by means of the AtlasMap runtime engine.
AtlasMap provides standard transformations and 
supports the creation of custom, user-defined transformations.  

AtlasMap UI is available:

* As a standalone application
* Embedded in 
link:https://syndesis.io/[Syndesis], which is an open-source integration platform

To execute the mappings created through AtlasMap UI,
there is a `camel-atlasmap` component that consumes an
AtlasMap mapping definition and processes data mappings as a part of a Camel route
https://camel.apache.org/components/latest/atlasmap-component.html

Also, There is a Camel Quarkus extension for AtlasMap
https://camel.apache.org/camel-quarkus/latest/reference/extensions/atlasmap.html
