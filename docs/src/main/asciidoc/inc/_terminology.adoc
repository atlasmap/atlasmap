|atlasmapping.xml, atlasmapping.json 

|Audit

|Useful during testing cycles, or when user does not have direct access to the runtime logs

|Collection
|A data type used in conversion that repeats 0 or more times
|Used to process Arrays and Lists

|Data Source
|The definition of an input or output data format within an AtlasMapping file
|atlas:java, atlas:json, atlas:xml, etc

|Used for mapping enumerations

|Mapping
|A grouping of input Field(s), output Field(s) and optionally Field Action(s) that defines the conversion to be performed at runtime within an AtlasMapping file
|JavaField -> JsonField, XmlField -> JsonField + Uppercase, etc

|Mapping Type
|The specific type of conversion that should be performed at runtime
|Map, Combine, Separate, Collection or Lookup

|Validation
|A Validation is a syntax check of a provide mapping file to ensure execution may proceeed
