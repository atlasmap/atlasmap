=== BOOTSTRAPPING

Bootstrapping the Data Mapper UI requires a bit of configuration. An example bootstrapping component is provided within the project:

ui/src/app/lib/atlasmap-data-mapper/components/data.mapper.example.host.component.ts

=== MODEL

All application data and configuration is stored in a centralized ConfigModel object.

The ConfigModel contains:

- initialization data such as service URLs and source/target document information
- references to our angular2 services that manage retrieving and saving our documents and mapping data
- document / mapping model objects

There are two document models contained within the ConfigModel object, both of type DocumentDefinition. A DocumentDefinition contains information about a source or target document such as the document's name, and fields for that document. Fields are represented by our Field model.

A single MappingDefinition model in the ConfigModel object stores information about field mappings and related lookup tables. Individual mappings are represented in instances of MappingModel, and lookup tables are represented by the LookupTable model.

=== SERVICE

When the Data Mapper UI Bootstraps, a series of service calls are made to the mapping service (MappingManagementService) and document service (DocumentManagementService). 

The document service is used to fetch our source/target document information (name of doc, fields). After these are parsed from the service, they are stored in the ConfigModel's inputDoc and outputDoc DocumentDefinition models.

The mapping service is used to fetch our mappings for the fields mapped from the source to the target document. These mappings (and related lookup tables) are parsed by the management service and stored in the ConfigModel's mappings MappingDefinition model.
