      title: AtlasMap Design Time Service API
      description: |
         AtlasMap is a data mapping solution with interactive web based user interface, that simplifies configuring
         integrations between Java, XML, and JSON data sources. You can design your data mapping with AtlasMap Data Mapper
         UI canvas, and then run that data mapping via runtime engine.

         This is the definition of the API used at runtime while designing a mapping.
