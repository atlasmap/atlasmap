**Describe the bug**
<!--

**Attach .adm file and source document examples**
<!--
The .adm archive file you can export from AtlasMap UI contains all metadata to reproduce your mapping. Also don't forget to provide source document examples to reproduce the runtime behavior exactly what you see.
NOTE: GitHub doesn't allow uploading the file with unsupported extension, e.g. .adm and .xsd. You would need to either 1) pack into a ZIP file or 2) add a fake extension like schema.xsd.txt
 -->
 
**Attach debug logs**
<!--
If it's a design time issue, attach a backend log with debug enabled
`java -Dlogging.level.io.atlasmap=debug -jar atlasmap-standalone.jar`
or for runtime issue, set the log level for `io.atlasmap` package to debug in your log4j config
