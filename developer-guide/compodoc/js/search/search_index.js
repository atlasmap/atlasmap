The ADM file is\nin (ZIP) file format.  Once pushed, we can retrieve from runtime the extracted compressed (GZIP) mappings\nfile catalog as well as the mappings JSON file.  These files exist separately for performance reasons.\nOnce the runtime has its ADM catalog, catalog files and mappings file set then restart the DM.\n\n\n                    \n                        Parameters :\n                        \n                            \n                                \n                                    Name\n                                    Type\n                                    Optional\n                                    Description\n                                \n                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    mappingsFileName\n                                    \n                                                string\n                                    \n\n                                    \n                                        No\n                                    \n\n\n                                    \n                                        \nADM master ZIP catalog\n\n\n                                    \n                                \n                            \n                        \n                    \n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        Returns :     Promise\n\n                    \n                    \n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                    \n                        \n                            resetAll\n                        \n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n            \n                \nresetAll()\n                \n            \n\n\n            \n                \n                    Defined in src/app/lib/atlasmap-data-mapper/services/file-management.service.ts:138\n                \n            \n\n\n            \n                \n                    Establish an observable function to delete mapping files on the runtime.\n\n\n                    \n                        Returns :     Observable\n\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                    \n                        \n                            setBinaryFileToService\n                        \n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n            \n                \nsetBinaryFileToService(compressedBuffer: any, url: string)\n                \n            \n\n\n            \n                \n                    Defined in src/app/lib/atlasmap-data-mapper/services/file-management.service.ts:186\n                \n            \n\n\n            \n                \n                    The user has either exported their mappings or imported new mappings.

web based user interface, that simplifies configuring integrations between Java, XML, and JSON data sources. You can design your data mapping on the AtlasMap Data Mapper UI canvas, and then run that data mapping via runtime engine. AtlasMap Data Mapper UI is primarily designed to work within the Syndesis UI.\nAtlasMap Documentation\nAll developer related documentation can be found at AtlasMap Documentation\nThe shortest path to run standalone AtlasMap\n\nCheckout AtlasMap repo from GitHub\n$ git clone https://github.com/atlasmap/atlasmap ${ATLASMAP}\nBuild AtlasMap runtime\n$ cd ${ATLASMAP}\n$ ./mvnw clean installor you can skip tests to get the build little bit faster\n$ ./mvnw clean install -DskipTests\nRun AtlasMap standalone\n$ cd ${ATLASMAP}/standalone\n$ ../mvnw -Pitests spring-boot:run\n\nThen AtlasMap UI is available at http://127.0.0.1:8585/ by default.\nLive update for UI development\nWhile standalone AtlasMap is running by following above, you can also run an another AtlasMap UI instance at different port by yarn start. This enables live update for UI code so you can see the outcome of your UI code change without build&restart manually.\n\nInstall Yarn\n\nInstall Data Mapper UI's dependencies\n$ cd ${ATLASMAP}/ui\n$ yarn install\nStart Data Mapper UI\n$ yarn start\n\nThe yarn start command will attempt to automatically open your browser window, but if it doesn't, open it directly with this URL: http://localhost:3000.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"license.html":{"url":"license.html","title":"getting-started - license","body":"\n                   \n\n            Apache License\n                       Version 2.0, January 2004\n                    http://www.apache.org/licenses/   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION\n\nDefinitions.\n\"License\" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,\nand distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.\n\"Licensor\" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by\nthe copyright owner that is granting the License.\n\"Legal Entity\" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all\nother entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common\ncontrol with that entity.
