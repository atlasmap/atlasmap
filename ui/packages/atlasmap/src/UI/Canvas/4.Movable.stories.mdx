# Movable

Any component in a <LinkTo kind='canvas/canvas' story='example'>Canvas</LinkTo> can be made movable through drag&drop
using the `Movable` renderprop component:

<Story name="Example">{stories.example()}</Story>

## Movable Props

<Props of={Movable} />

## Stories

### Can be disabled

<Story name="Disabled">{stories.disabled()}</Story>

### `HTMLObject` components can be made movable

<Story name="HTMLObject">{stories.htmlObject()}</Story>

### Multiple movable elements don't overlap

Note: this works only if all the elements in the canvas are `Movable`.

<Story name="Multiple movable">{stories.multipleMovable()}</Story>
