== AtlasMap running with Apache Camel3 :: Message Map
https://github.com/atlasmap/atlasmap/tree/master/examples/camel3/camel-example-atlasmap-msgmap

=== Introduction

This example shows how to perform data mapping from multiple source
Documents and corresponding headers stored in Message Map with using
AtlasMap Data Mapper running as a part of Camel route. AtlasMap expects
Message Map to hold Camel Message with a Document ID as a key. The
Message headers are handled as a scoped property where Document ID is
equal to the scope. Syndesis provides this message mapping feature
internally so that the Data Mapper step can consume multiple source
Messages as well as headers. In this example, `MessageCaptureProcessor`
does that part of managing Message Map.
